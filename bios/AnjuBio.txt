I grew up in Bombay, India most of my life and came to the US around 8 years ago. I later moved from LA to a small town in California called Elk Grove. I graduated from Franklin High and was admitted into Berkeley in fall 2011. I became interested in Computer Science and have since taken CS10, CS61a and CS61bl. I have also worked as a Quality Analyst Intern in Netvarth, helping manage the Restaurant Management System and update the Forkworld Search engine, volunteered as a CS10 lab assistant, and have been a member of AWE(Association of Women in EECS), CSUA and Leadership Symposium.
