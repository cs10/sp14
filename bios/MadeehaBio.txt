WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR ACADEMIC PATH?

I actually grew up here in Cali!


HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?

I would say that my programming experience mimicks the recipe for shortbread cookies: 

2 cups Scratch/BYOB,

2 cups python,

and 1/2 cup C#

(for shortbread cookies, please replace Scratch with flour and C# with sugar. Then divide the amount of python by 2 and replace python with softened butter. Mix ingredients together to form a batter. Place batter into 13' pan and bake at 300 degrees for half an hour.)
 

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I always enjoy a good book or TV show. I also enjoy hiking and rockclimbing and getting coffee with my cs10 friends. (These friends are for life, yo. So don't knock your cs10 class).

But the most pervasive hobby of mine is making awful puns and unnecessarily flowery analogies. (See recipe for shortbread cookies)
 

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?

making awful puns and unnecessarily flowery analogies.
 

HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE?

Once I was in this terrible boating accident and ended up marooned on a deserted desert island. My only companion was a prisoner I released from the native cannibals, who I most uncreatively named after a day of the week. Hold on...that was Robinson Crusoe.
 
Umm...once I gave a friend a refillable teabag in the shape of a deep sea diver. It was called the Deep Tea Diver. I was pretty proud of myself there.

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?

I'm taking CS61B and CS70, which promise to fun and time-consuming. I'll also be lab assisting for the online version of CS10 and hopefully taking a class on animated graphics. Lots of great nerdy stuff going on this semester.
