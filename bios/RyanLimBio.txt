WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grew up in Alameda, a town not far from Berkeley. Cal was the most awesomest school I got into, and I'm glad I ended up here. 

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
I took CS 10 Fall 2012, and I have experience with Matlab, Javascript (some jQuery), and a bit of python.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I like to play/watch sports (Go Sharks!), do things in nature, solve puzzles, memorize things, play music, and be spontaneous. 

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
I can solve a Rubik's Cube. Blindfolded. Also with one hand. And with my feet. I can also solve other cubes: 2x2-7x7, mirror blocks, pyraminx, megaminx, square-1, and lots others. If you want to learn you can ask me in lab!  

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
I won first in team blindfold solving with my partner at the 2012 US National Rubik's Cube competition. This summer at work I saw Miley Cyrus, Darren Criss, Seth Rogan, Ludacris, James Blunt, Kurt Busch, and just missed Kobe Bryant.

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
I'm taking Math 185, Stat 133, ESPM 155C, CS9G, and lab assisting. I'm also working part time at Twitter, I teach a DeCal (Rubik's Cubing), and I'm the President of the Rubik's Cube Club.
