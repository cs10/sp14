WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I was born in Wisconsin, but I've lived in San Jose all my life so I just 
consider myself a Californian with a extremely high tolerance for the cold.
And now I'm at Cal as a third year statistics major! I'm still not sure which
career path I want to take though; currently I'm looking at either education, 
data science, or the actuarial path. Or all of the above, since Berkeley's all
about overachieving.

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

BYOB/Snap (in English).
I suppose you could also count R (in English), which is a program similar 
to MATLAB except no one uses it aside from statisticians. 
I'm also taking a self-paced Java course this semester (also in English,
though I may take a stab at the Swahili version)

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

Sometimes I draw. I'd like to do it more but the Internet is so distracting. 
I mostly draw Sailor Moon fanart and design dresses and outfits, things like that. 
Shameless plug: If you have a deviantART, you can find me at g-i-i.deviantart.com!
I also attempt to be funny sometimes, but honestly I shouldn't have to try as hard
as I do considering the fact that my life is a joke. 

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

Being mistaken for the other Audrey Chou at UC Berkeley. If you try to find me 
online, chances are it'll be her. I'm sure she's a wonderful person, though.

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I got stuck in an elevator at Stern at the end of last semester for half an hour. 
Earlier that day, Kou made me carry a huge desk through campus from South Side to 
West Side. (He also really wanted me to write about this, so here we go.)
Oh, and my roommate just won us a ton of IKEA furniture from Caltopia. Yeah.

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

Avoiding elevators at all costs. At least the ones in Stern.
