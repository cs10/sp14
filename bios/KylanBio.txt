WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR ACADEMIC PATH?

I grew up in Fremont, CA and have actually lived in the bay area my entire life.
I love it here! Moving onto my academic path, I actually had no idea I was going
to major in Computer Science until I fell in love with it in CS10! Now I’m
pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Business Administration.


HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?

I took CS10 just last semester, so other than BYOB and Scratch, I’m picking up
Scheme in CS61AS right now.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

Playing volleyball (both sand and indoor!), watching movies and a bajillion
different TV shows, cooking, singing, meeting new people, laughing, learning new
things, and I also really, REALLY love teaching.


WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?

I did gymnastics for several years before being forced to quit from chipping a
bone in my elbow. After growing a foot after quitting, surprisingly, I can still
do some tricks! 

HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE?

I would probably say competing in the Junior Olympics for gymnastics and also
starting two non-profit organizations in high school.


WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?

Teaching is a huge passion of mine so I started a Public Speaking and Leadership
DeCal this semester. I love every moment of teaching it and developing the
course to better my students! I’m also the Co-President of the Student Commuters
at Cal, a board member for the Vice Chancellor Student Advisory Committee for
Student Affairs, a Regional Coordinator for the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation,
and am playing for an intramural volleyball team. I’m also starting a company
right now, which is set to launch in January 2012! Other than all that business,
I'm hoping to really enjoy myself here at Berkeley and utilize as many learning
opportunities as possible.
