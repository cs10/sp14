WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR ACADEMIC PATH?
I grew up in El Cerrito, which is literally a 10-minute BART ride away from
campus (long trek from home, I know). I went to El Cerrito High, and from there
went to Berkeley in Fall of 2010, which is also when I took the first offering of CS10! I came in undeclared in L&S (heading towards an English route oddly enough), but after I took CS10, I got hooked into programming, and am now in my final year at Cal as a Computer Science major!


HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?
My first language was Scratch/BYOB (which has now evolved into Snap!) when I took CS10. After that I learned Scheme, Java, and C which I learned in CS61a and CS61b  and CS61c. respectively I learned a lot of web development languages over the past few years, so I've gotten fairly good at JavaScript, jQuery, WinJS, HTML5, CSS3, and Node.js.

I also know a decent amount of UNIX, Python (my faveorite!), and a little bit of Ruby.


WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I love to swim (did it competitively for 10 years!), discover new bands to
listen to, play guitar, and try random restaurants!


WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?
Again, swimming is a big one. I made it to NCS and Far Westerns senior year of
high school, and had previously competed in the Junior Olympics. Guitar has been
something I picked up more recently, but it's my favorite way to relax.


HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE?
At my last internship, I helped build a media app for a major TV network for a next-gen console!

Also, I survived (and did pretty well in) CS61b with Professor Paul Hilfinger.


WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?
In addition to being a TA for CS10, some of the classes I'll be taking
include CS162 (OS), Info C262 (Tangible UI), and Geo70AC. I'll also
keep Berkeley up to date with music as the Lead Music Critic for the Daily
Californian!
