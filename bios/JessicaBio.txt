\f0\fs24 \cf0 WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? \'a0WHAT WAS YOUR ACADEMIC PATH?\
\
I grew up in Laguna Niguel, California (that's south of LA) and went to Aliso Niguel High School. I knew I wanted to go to Cal since I was a freshman at ANHS so I'm very happy to be here. :)\
\
HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE? \'a0WHAT LANGUAGES?\
\
I learned Scheme for CS61A and programmed in Java, C, and C++ for a couple years. I also learned Javascript and jQuery this summer and a little bit of PHP. Currently I'm learning Python for CS188. \
\
WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES? WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?\
\
I like reading about science, history and philosophy, and I also enjoy fiction a lot, whether in books, comics, or movies. I can also play guitar and piano, make clothes from sewing patterns, and speak a tiny bit of French (I was better before I got out of practice). I've dabbled in snowboarding, hiking, and mountain biking. \
\
HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE?\
\
In retrospect, probably the most unusual thing I've done was running the LA Marathon in 2005, when I was 12 years old. I hope to top that eventually!\
\
WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?\
\
In addition to my regular classwork (CS188, CS169, Music 158) and being reader for CSw10, I'll be looking for full-time employment and learning more technologies, especially web and iPhone app development. }
