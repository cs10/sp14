I'm pretty good at troubleshooting computers in general since I have interned at Synopsys' IT department the last two summers. The best talent I have is probably my willingness to help. I love and enjoy helping my friends and peers to find solutions to different problems and issues.

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I met Bill Nye the Science Guy while volunteering at the Tech Museum in San Jose and got a photo of him and me. He's a really nice person and definitely willing to talk and meet fans who watched his videos in elementary and middle school.
