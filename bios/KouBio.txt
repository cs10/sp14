Where did you grow up? What was your academic path?

I grew up in the Heart of Silicon Valley that is San Jose, California. I went to Santa Clara High School (I was close to the border of San Jose/Santa Clara). I am now a 3rd year Environmental Economics & Policy major and I plan to also complete a minor in Computer Science.

How much programming have you done (& what languages)?

When I got to Cal, I had absolutely no programming experience at all. I took CS10 in Fall 2011, CS61A in Spring 2012, and now currently taking CS61B. So I have had some experience coding in BYOB, Python, and Scheme. Currently learning Java in CS61B.

What are your hobbies?

My hobbies include playing video games (preferably on the PS3), watching anime, reading manga, doing photography, bowling, gokart racing, and hanging out with my friends. Also love watching hockey (hope there isn't a lockout this year :/).

What are some of your talents & skills?

I'm generally good about troubleshooting computers, and have a little bit of graphic design skills. The best talent I have is probably is my willingness to help. I love helping others and finding solutions together with others.

Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything really memorable happened to you?

Not that I can think of right now……maybe nearly burning down my kitchen before a summer Stat 20 final a few summers ago?

What commitments will be consuming your cycles this term?

I'm taking EEP 151, EEP C181, Public Health 116, and CS61B. Also, I will try to lab assist for 2 CS10 sections. This semester will be quite busy and fun :)
